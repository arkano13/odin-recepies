        <h2>Descripcion </h2>
        <p>For years, Chicago was the banner city when it came to distinctly midwestern pizza.<br>
             Though deep dish has long had its day, the balance of power over the past decade<br>
              seems to have shifted eastward to Detroit. Now, one of the pizza world's worst-kept<br>
               secrets seems poised to hit the mainstream with a bit of help from Pizza Hut.</p>

               <p> This month, Pizza Hut is launching its mass-market take on Detroit style pizza,<br>
                 making it the first time that a pizza chain of its size is bringing Michigan's cheesy,<br>
                  saucy export nationwide. Their rectangular pies will be divided into four unique product offerings:<br>
                   Double Detroit Pepperoni, which loads up each pie with 80 pepperoni slices, Double Cheesy,<br>
                    Meaty Deluxe, and the Italian sausage, red onions, and green bell peppers of the Supremo pie.</p>
